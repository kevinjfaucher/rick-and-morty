# rick-and-morty

    App Introduction: As the user starts the app, they'll see a title "Rick and Morty App" displayed at the top.

    Character Name Input: Underneath the title, there's a textbox asking users to "Enter character name". Here, they can type the name of their favorite character from Rick and Morty.

    Fetching Character Data: After typing the character's name, the user can click the "Get Character" button. The app will then try to fetch and display information about that character.

    Displaying Character Information:

        If successful, the user will see:
            A picture of the character.
            The character's name.
            Their status (Alive, Dead, etc.).
            The species of the character (e.g., "Human").
            The gender of the character.

        If the character name isn't found or there's a problem getting the data, an error message will display: "Failed to fetch character data or character not found".

    New Searches: Users can search for another character by typing a new name into the textbox and clicking the button again.
